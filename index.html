            <h2>Essex Beloved Cricket Club ‘at risk’ after major incident: </h2>
            <ul class="article-list">
               <p>Essex village cricket club’s future is allegedly at risk after reported incident in which a cricket ball hit a civilian's leg at 57mph. The club reported the incident on 17th May when Danbury cricket club played the team of South Woodham and Burnham. The Parish Council has suspended cricket after the incident in which a ball struck a person in the car park on the leg or ankle. Rory Calton, 36, club secretary of Danbury Cricket Club, said no players had any recollection of the incident, which was reported at the attached leisure centre and passed to the local council. Mr Calton said the Parish Council said the nearby car park would need to be closed, which the club supported and said they would provide signs to warn people of matches being played. But they were later told that cricket had been suspended in totality. The pitch is used by Danbury Cricket Club, Tuskers Cricket Club, and Oakland's Cricket Club. If the suspension were made permanent, all three teams would be left without a home and in need of somewhere new to play. "It's catastrophic for us and the other clubs,” said Mr Calton, "It's a wider issue that there's a shortage of grounds, perhaps through things like this. We have no other place to play.” </p>
               
               <p>Councillors and residents will meet this evening at 7:30 PM to discuss the suspension of cricket in the village. Following this, there will be an additional meeting on 23rd June when a health and safety report will be received. In hopes of preventing this tragedy, approximately 1,500 residents of the village have united to sign a petition to preserve the village sport. Furthermore, Sir John Whittingdale, MP for Maldon (Cons.) and a former Minister of State for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, said he understands the concerns of the cricket clubs. He added: "I share their view that cricket on the green is an integral part of English village life which is enjoyed by both players and spectators and would be very sad if it did not continue." </p>
               
               <p>The MP continued: "I accept that the Parish Council need to investigate any potential health and safety risks and welcome the meetings being organised by the Parish Council to consider this. I hope for a swift outcome that will allow cricket to continue to be played safely and without risk to any others in the village." </p>
               
               <p>As of June 19th, it is unsure of the following result of the closure of this cherished cricket club. Residents hope that the council will make the decision to keep the club open but for now we cannot be certain.  </p>
